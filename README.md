Title: Forest escape

Short description: This is a mini-game meant to exercise the tree implemenetation structure, as well as error handling in Python.

Long description:
The game is desgined to touch on the following points:
1. have a minimal story line and narrative linearity;
2. take user input and advance the game based on the choices selected by the user;
3. interpret the user choices as a new choice in the "tree branch";
4. have error handling at the beginning, for when a user is accessing and starting the game.

Disclaimer:
The mini-game aims at being a clean, simple, and easy implementation in code of a choice-based fun, activity.

This is a fine-tuned project, from an older version of the same game.

Everything listed here is free and has the purpose of serving as a training/educational resource for the current GitHub user (the author).

Title: Forest escape

Short description: This is a mini-game meant to exercise the tree implemenetation structure, as well as error handling in Python.

Long description:

Being an older mini game I wrote for learning purposes, this was initially developed on Replit. I have later improved and tweaked it a little bit; also used the occasion to move code from Replit directly into Github (hence the residual replit files contained in the repository).

The actual code of the mini app is all contained in main.py. Since the mini classes definition are not laborious, I have decided to not separate them on files and keep everything in the main file.

The game is desgined to touch on the following points:
1. have a minimal story line and narrative linearity;
2. take user input and advance the game based on the choices selected by the user;
3. interpret the user choices as a new choice in the "tree branch";
4. have error handling at the beginning, for when a user is accessing and starting the game.

Disclaimer:
The mini-game aims at being a clean, simple, and easy implementation in code of a choice-based fun, activity.

This is a fine-tuned project, from an older version of the same game.

Everything listed here is free and has the purpose of serving as a training/educational resource for the current GitHub user (the author).
